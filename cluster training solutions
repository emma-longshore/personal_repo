(Q1) What are the two objects?
The two objects are empty folders ‘.’ And ‘..’
(Q2) Open the file and take a look at what is in the VCF file using cat, more, and less commands. Which command did you find the most useful and why? 
The less command is the most helpful as it shows the beginning of the file (often containing structural information)
(Q3) How many lines does the VCF file have? (hint: do not count the lines manually and use one line command) 
200 lines
(Q4) How much did the gzip and bzip2 commands compress the original VCF? Which command would you use and why?
Size was reduced by over 50%. Original size with no metadata is 29945 and after gzip and bzip2 10139
(Q5) Can you still see the file using more or less (Type q to quit) and why?
The file opens, but is unreadable due to the file not being fully downloaded
(Q6) What are the advantages and disadvantages? 
Soft links are beneficial in routing to the original file, while hard links are a direct copy. They are particularly useful when working with large file sizes
(Q7) How many chromosomes did you find in the FASTA file?
123 chromosomes
(Q8) What command did you use? Describe the command options you used. Describe potential issues if `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` is not used. 
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) \
                blcdsdockerregistry/samtools:1.12 \
                samtools faidx linked
I simply used the -v option to ensure the samtools and docker versions are being pulled from the present working directory
If `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` is not used, the output file names are default and may be difficult to decipher
(Q9) Are they identical or not? If not, how did you find the difference? 
No, they are not identical. Differences were determined using sha512sum failink
(Q10) Run the same docker image interactively with the -u $(id -u):$(id -g) option. Explain why you see

docker run --rm -v -u $(id -u):$(id -g)-w $(pwd) \
                blcdsdockerregistry/samtools:1.12 \
                samtools faidx linked
(Q11) How many CPUs does the node have? 
2
(Q12) How much RAM (in GB) does the node have? 
3.7G
(Q13) What is the ratio of CPU:RAM in Fsv2-series? 
1.85G per core
(Q14) How many F2, F16 , F32, F72 and M64 nodes are available in total (including allocated nodes) for each partition?
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
F16          up   infinite      4    mix F16-[1,3-5]
F16          up   infinite      1  alloc F16-2
F2*          up   infinite      4  idle~ F2-[28,30,35,39]
F2*          up   infinite     38  alloc F2-[1-27,29,31-34,36-38,40-42]
F32          up   infinite     10  idle~ F32-[1-10]
F72          up   infinite      8  idle~ F72-[7,19-25]
F72          up   infinite     17  alloc F72-[1-6,8-18]
M64          up   infinite      1  idle~ M64-1
(Q15) What command did you use? How do you show the allocated CPUs and RAM?
srun --exclusive --partition="F16" –mem 4000 –-cpus 2 --pty bash
cpus/cores defines allocated computers, mem allocates memory in gigabytes
(Q16) An F16 node was spun up using `srun` command and the node was used for 30 hours and only 50% of available CPUs were used. The user forgot to exit the node for extra 4 days but no CPUs were used during the time. Estimate the computing costs of the srun session. (hint: see Cluster configuration) 
9 cpus @ 126 hrs~$.42/h
$52.92 computational cost
(Q17) An F72 node was spun up using `sbatch` command. The align-DNA pipeline ran for 40 hours and the node was decommissioned. Only ~50% of /scratch was used for storing intermediate files. Estimate the computing costs of the sbatch job. (hint: see Cluster configuration) 
40 hrs @ $1.8/hr
$72 computational cost
(Q18) Estimate our current monthly expenses of the cloud storage (/hot) using a cache disk rate - $0.000024 (GB/h) (hint: use `df -h /hot` and assume we use an additional 50% of data for snapshot e.g. 2TB for /hot and 1TB for snapshot) What can you do to reduce the expenses next month?
Current use in /hot – 1.3p
1.3p + 3 TB @ 730hrs~$0.000024 (GB/h)
$32.272/hour or $22,828.56/month
(Q19) Check /hot/users/permission-test and see which directories you have permission to write (hint: type ls -lh and also, see /etc/group) and explain why
[elongshore@ip-0A125223 clustertraining]$ ls -lh /hot/users/permission-test
